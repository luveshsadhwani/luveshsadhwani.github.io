                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>A graduate in chemical engineering, the wandering programmer Luvesh is an individual who has 
                    developed a structured approach to solving complex problems. Starting out with excel formulas
                    since primary school, Luvesh has looked to utilize the power of programming to solve logistical
                    problems.
                    
                    Currently working in SOLS Energy, Luvesh has a myriad of tasks ranging from customer service,
                    technical support and application development. He is learning website development outside of work
                    and aims to go into web development. Future aspirations look towards software development and consulting
                    for SMEs to optimize their internal business operations.

                    He is a wanderer to his self-interests in reading, politics, video games and renewable energy.
